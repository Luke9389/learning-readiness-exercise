Learning Readiness Exercise
===

## Intro

This project repository contains code for a web page, listed in the
file [index.html](index.html). It also uses another file [friends.json](friends.json) that contains
data that will be used from `index.html`.

**You can view a running version of the site [here](https://alchemycodelab.github.io/learning-readiness-exercise/)**

(NOTE: You are welcome to download or copy the code and run it locally on your machine, but that is not required. Be aware that most modern
browsers will not allow a file to request other files from your computer for security reasons. This means you may not see the rendered
list of friends. You _can_ use a static web server, but that is beyond the scope of this exercise)

## About `index.html`

The `index.html` file contains three different coding languages:

1. The file itself is written in `HTML`
1. Inside the `<style>` tag is `CSS`
1. Inside the `<script>` tag is `JavaScript`

In the "real world", we usually split the `CSS` and `JavaScript` into separate files, but for simplicity they
have been "inlined", meaning including directly within the `HTML` file.

## Goal

You may not be familiar with some, or even _any_, of the code used in this project. This exercise 
is **not** about what you may or may not already know about the code being used. What it **is** about:

1. Attention to detail and your ability to follow through on instructions
2. What you are able to research and learn on your own about _what you do not know_
3. Your ability to communicate your experiences specifically with examples

This code sample is designed to have some parts that are new for a variety of incoming backgrounds, including true
beginners who very little about code, and those who may have had some exposure  practice in coding. 

**It is important that you focus on what is unfamiliar to you.**

If you feel that you fully understand _all_ of the code being used (including the JavaScript) and 
could write such code yourself, you should probably talk with us about testing into a higher level course.

## Instructions: Part 1

In preparation for the interview, please take some time (but you do not need to spend more than an hour) to
go through the following process several times:

1. Formulate a question you have about the code. This may be based on:
    * Your curiosity
    * Seeking basic understanding
    * Something you don't understand well
    * Something different or new that you haven't seen
2. Do some online research and see if you can:
    * Find answers,
    * Come up with more refined questions, and/or
    * Come up with new questions that the research inspires
3. Be **prepared to share**:
   * What you found out **concretely and specifically**
   * What was still confusing or things that you did not find answers to
    
Again, the interview is **not** about technical knowledge or experience, but rather about _your
approach to encountering new things and learning_. 

You are welcome to bring in notes or your computer to the LRE interview

## Instructions: Part 2

During the interview you will also be asked about:

1. A **specific** experience in any area of your life in which you solved a problem or overcame
a challenge and what you felt were the critical actions or approaches you took to achieving success
2. Why the day-to-day activity of coding is appealing to you
