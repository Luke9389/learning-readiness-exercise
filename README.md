Learning Readiness Exercise
===

This project repository contains code for a web page, listed in the
file called [index.html](index.html). 

You may not be familiar with some, or even _any_, of the code used in this project. This exercise 
is **not** about what you may or may not already know about the code being used. Rather it
is about:

1. What you are able to learn on your own about what you do not know.
2. Attention to detail and your ability to follow through on instructions.

If you feel that you fully understand _all_ of the code being used (including the JavaScript) and 
could write such code yourself, you should probably talk with us about testing into a higher level course.

In preparation for the interview, please take some time (but you do not need to spend more than an hour) to
go through the following process several times:

1. Formulate a question you have about the code. This may be based on:
    * Seeking basic understanding
    * Something you don't understand well
    * Something different or new that you haven't seen
    * Your curiosity
2. Do some online research and see if you can:
    * Find answers
    * Come up with more refined questions
    * Come up with new questions that the research inspires
3. Be prepared to share what you learned and explain the process you 
went through **concretely and specifically**
    
Again, the interview is **not** about technical knowledge, but rather about _your
approach to encountering new things and learning_. 

In addition, during the interview you will also be asked about:

* Specific experiences in any area of your life in which you solved a problem or overcame
a challenge and what you felt were the critical actions you took to achieving success.
* Why the day-to-day activity of coding is appealing to you.
